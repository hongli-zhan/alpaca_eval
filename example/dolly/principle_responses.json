I still can't get over that ending. How did you interpret it?\n\nActor B: I think Cobb is still dreaming, but it's open to interpretation. The spinning top is such a powerful symbol of his internal struggle.\n\nActor A: True. And the power of suggestion was another strong theme. Remember when Cobb planted the idea of a safe in Fischer's mind? Brilliant.\n\nActor B: Definitely. It makes me reflect on how our own consciousness can be influenced by subtle cues.
