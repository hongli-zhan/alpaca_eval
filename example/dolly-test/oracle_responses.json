This hunting instinct is completely normal, and it isn't fair to the cat to try to train it not to attack birds, as it is simply in its nature to do so. However, letting a cat hunt your pet bird is similarly not humane, as it will be very stressful to the bird and could lead to the bird being injured. Larger birds are also not a good idea, as the bird could cause injury to the cat if the cat tries to attack it. Overall, it just isn't a good idea to have both cats and birds, since they tend not to coexist well, and pet owners should just pick one species to have.",

        "output": "There are infinite ways to create interesting flavours, that are either personal favourites or attempt to replicate classic beers and beer styles. There are a number of factors that make up a beers flavour profile and part of the enjoyment brewing your own beer at home, is that you can play around with each of these to change the flavour and character of your homebrew beer. Here are five ways in which you can change your own homebrew recipe to add interesting flavours or alternatively you can alter an existing homebrew recipe shared by somebody else or a brewery.\n\n1. Use different hops\nThere is a huge variety of hops available to homebrewers and each of these can introduce its own particular flavour and aroma to your beer, ranging from pineapple and apricots, to pine trees and woods, to grapefruit pith and lemon zest. By using a different hop in your recipe either from the same family or from an entirely different family of hops, you can easily add interesting and often radical changes to the flavour profile of your beer. However, depending on when the hops are added in the brewing process, you can also increase/decrease the levels of bitterness of your beer, due to different hop varieties having different levels of alpha acids.\n\n2. Use a different yeast\nBesides fermenting the beer, yeast leave behind lots of interesting flavours and can give your homebrew it's own subtle character. For example, English yeast strains can add malty and sweet flavours, California yeast tends to create a clean and crisp beer, whilst saison yeast adds bright and fruity flavours to your beer.\n\n3. Use different grains\nChanging the amount of base malts can increase or decrease the alcohol in your finished beer. Trying swapping one base malt for another, like American pale malts for a British variety, and look for the subtle differences between them. You can also play around with the specialty grains, like using a slightly darker roast.\n\n4. Add fruit, spices or herbs\nFruits, spices, herbs, and other ingredients are a great way to add an entirely personal character to your homebrew. Anything from fresh strawberries and basil to vanilla beans and cardamom can really complement the other malty, hoppy flavours in a beer. \n\n5. Alter your water profile\nDifferent beer styles will typically be best achieved with a suitable water profile, with different levels of minerals to achieve the desired flavour profile. By adjusting the amounts of specific minerals found in your brewing water, beer can be made to taste fuller bodied, sweeter, drier, more bitter, or even sour.",

With her brother-in-law out of town, Lisa had agreed to watch her niece Stella for the afternoon and the little girl was known to be a bit of a handful. Her plan had been to spend the afternoon at the park to let Stella run and climb, to wear her out a bit.  Unfortunately, this outing was foiled by the constant downpour of rain so Lisa resigned herself to a day inside with the tiny tyrant. Stella arrived early and excited to play.  Lisa decided to begin with a game of hide and seek, after all this could take up a good part of the morning without too much trouble.  Stella ran off to hide and Lisa sat quietly drinking coffee while calling out to the little girl, pretending to seek. Eventually she set off to find the little girl but soon she realized that something was wrong.  No matter where she looked, Stella was nowhere to be found. The house wasn't that large, making her disappearance even more perplexing.  Lisa had only recently moved into the home that she bought from her great aunt shortly before her death and she hasn't even moved out all of the existing furniture. Maybe Stella had gotten stuck somewhere behind the large wardrobe in the bedroom or she had climbed up into a cupboard in the laundry room.  Panic was starting to settle in as she moved the wardrobe further from the wall, where only a small child could have hidden before.  Suddenly, saw a small crack in the wall, and then realized it was a small door that she never knew was there.  The door was slightly ajar and she eventually moved the wardrobe enough to open the door and climb inside. What was this place?  The entrance opened up to reveal a small room that Lisa never knew existed!  It was full of treasure, gold bars and jewels.  Stella sat in the middle of the room quietly playing with the treasure, unaware of the immense value she was surrounded by.  Lisa had known her aunt was a secretive woman but this was an incredible find and would change her life forever.  Stella's visit was the good luck charm she needed to unlock this bounty and she would be forever grateful to the little girl!  Time to call her brother-in-law to thank him for letting Stella visit.",

Smoke and ash from the fires can cause respiratory problems and other health issues, and the destruction of habitats can harm wildlife populations and disrupt entire ecosystems.\n\nDespite the challenges, California has made significant progress in fighting wildfires in recent years. The state has invested in new technologies and equipment to help firefighters respond more quickly and effectively to fires, and has increased efforts to prevent fires from starting in the first place.\n\nWhile wildfires will likely always be a risk in California, the state's proactive approach to managing them gives hope that we can continue to protect people, wildlife, and the environment from their devastating effects.",
